# Arctic Quiz 

With the current climate change the face of the artic is changing rapidly. This has a major impact on the flora and fauna. Small children don't know a lot about the artic. The Artic quiz was developed for children to improve their knowledge about the artic and stimulate their curiosity in a fun and interactive way. In this way we hope to contribute to the overall conscience of the people.
